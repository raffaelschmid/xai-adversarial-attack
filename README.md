# Explainable AI - Adversarial Attack

The purpose of this project was to accomplish an assignment that was given during the
[Explainable AI](https://www.fhnw.ch/de/weiterbildung/technik/explainable-ai) course at
[FHNW](https://www.fhnw.ch).

## Project

The primary goal of the project is to make SHAP based explanations for a model that was trained for predicting digits
based on MNIST images. Afterwards adversarial images are generated in order to analyze and discover resulting
miss-predictions again using SHAP.

The content of this project is aligned as follows:

1. Modelling

|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| /data          | Storage location for data. Raw data is downloaded to raw, after processing stored to processed. Trained models are stored in model subdirectory. |
| /models        | Location for model definitions.                                                                                                                  |
| /notebooks     | Jupyter notebooks are stored in the eda (Exploratory Data Analysis), modeling (Modeling) and evaluation (Evaluation) directories.                |
| /reporting     | Extracted Python code that is used during reporting.                                                                                             |
